# RandomCosmeticsTF2
A small Java program I made that generates three cosmetics of a selected class from the videogame Team Fortress 2, from a list of available cosmetics. Each cosmetic has its own weight depending on its quality and if it's modified or not. The program can also filter halloween cosmetics.
